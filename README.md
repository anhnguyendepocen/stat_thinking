# Chapters
1. Introduction    
    a. Statistics vs Data Science    
    b. Experiments vs Observations    
    c. Data Structure    
2. Visualization - univariate (to show syntax), present multivariate (two/three variable) to explore complex questions.    
     a. Explore distributions    
          1. density plots    
          2. histograms    
          3. violin plots

11. Classification - move this earlier, more concrete for many students.  
     a. overfitting.   
     b. cross-validation.   
     c. performance measures.
